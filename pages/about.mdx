**Blue0x is Banking. Reimagined.** 

Blue0x is focused on overhauling the current financial system by identifying and rectifying it's weaknesses and inequalities through the use of distributed ledger technology/blockchain.  It provides a network to bridge the gap between tangible goods and services and a sustainable, decentralized cryptocurrency. Blue0x transactions are processed using a lightweight, energy-efficient [proof of stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) consensus protocol which has proven to be secure and reliable. The Blue0x Network is designed to be fully decentralized with no central point of failure.  The wallet, the marketplace and the exchange are all modular sections of the entire network that interact with each other and operate fully on-chain and in real-time. When the wallet, market and exchange are hosted locally on your machine, transactions are signed only within your local environment and your private keys are never exposed to the outside world.  


**Within the Blue0x Network :**

* Blue0x | [CURRENCIES](currencies.md)  currencies modeled after real-world fiat currencies (i.e. USD  USDX)

* Blue0x | [MARKET](marketplace.md)  buy and sell physical goods and services in your native Blue0x currency

* Blue0x | [EXCHANGE](exchange.md)  exchange your native Blue0x currency with other Blue0x currencies around the world (i.e. USDX EURX)

This facilitates a REAL USE CASE for cryptocurrency, not simply speculation of price in relation to fiat currency.  Blue0x does not plan to have any fiat currency on/off ramps and is not intended to be traded on any of the popular, centralized exchanges.ₐ   Blue0x strives to have a fully self-contained ecosystem, independent of fiat and other cryptocurrencies, that will evolve into a well-trusted platform to ultimately replace the current financial system.


*ₐ With the nature of a decentralized network, the Blue0x Dev team cannot maintain any amount of control over BLX or Blue0x currencies.  However, we hope to foster a mindset and a culture within the user community that will enable this vision to become a reality.*
