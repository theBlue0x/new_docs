  This guide explains you how to link a domain to your dashboard. If you want to expose other apps, you need to configure them individually. You cannot use the `--domain` option to expose individual apps.

If you want to link a domain to your dashboard, you can do so by providing the `--domain` option in the start script.

```bash
sudo ./scripts/start.sh --domain mydomain.com
```

You can also specify it in the `settings.json` file as shown in the previous section to keep the setting saved across restarts.

```json
{
  "domain": "mydomain.com"
}
```

A Let's Encrypt certificate will be generated and installed automatically. Make sure to have ports 80 and 443 open on your firewall and that your domain has an **A** record pointing to your server IP.

Please note that this setting will only expose the dashboard. If you want to expose other apps, you need to configure them individually. You cannot use the `--domain` option to expose apps.

This option will only work if you keep the default port 80 and 443 for the dashboard.
