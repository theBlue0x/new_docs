# Customize app config

## Overview

In this guide, we'll show you how to customize the configuration of an app by overriding the default `docker-compose.yml` and `app.env` files.

## Example use cases

- Set `Pihole` to listen on a custom IP address
- Mount an existing volume on your host into a media app such as `Jellyfin`. *By default, media apps will only be able to see files within `runtipi/media`, but you can add other volumes.*

An alternative approach to mounting a volume into an app would be to symlink your host volume into `runtipi/media`. However, that would make it visible to all apps that mount the `media` folder, which may not be desirable.

## Create custom docker config

In this example we're going to add environment variables to the `Pihole` app and mount the `/cellar` volume into the `Jellyfin` app.

To determine how to set environment variables to customize the `Pihole` container, we look at `runtipi/apps/pihole/docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
ports:
  - ${NETWORK_INTERFACE:-0.0.0.0}:53:53/tcp
  - ${NETWORK_INTERFACE:-0.0.0.0}:53:53/udp
  - ${NETWORK_INTERFACE:-0.0.0.0}:${APP_PORT}:80
```

From this, we know that we need to set the `NETWORK_INTERFACE` variable.

<Callout>
  Don't edit the files in the `apps` folder directly; they will be overwritten on update.
</Callout>

1. Create `user-config` folder within `runtipi` and a folder for each app:
```bash
cd runtipi
mkdir user-config
mkdir user-config/jellyfin
mkdir user-config/pihole
```

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` for `jellyfin` and add this content:

```bash
touch user-config/jellyfin/docker-compose.yml
nano user-config/jellyfin/docker-compose.yml
```

```yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  jellyfin:
    volumes:
      - /cellar:/cellar
```

<Callout>
  Replace `/cellar` with the volume you want to mount.
</Callout>

3. Create an `app.env` for `pihole` and add this content:

```bash
touch user-config/pihole/app.env
nano user-config/pihole/app.env
```

```conf
NETWORK_INTERFACE=10.20.0.53
```

<Callout>
  Replace `10.20.0.53` with the IP address you want pihole to listen on.
</Callout>

4. You should end up with a structure like this:

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="runtipi" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="app-data" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="apps" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="user-config" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.Folder name="jellyfin" defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.File name="docker-compose.yml" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
            <FileTree.Folder name="pihole" defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.File name="app.env" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

5. Restart the apps and test:

```bash
./scripts/app.sh stop jellyfin
./scripts/app.sh stop pihole
./scripts/app.sh start jellyfin
./scripts/app.sh start pihole
```

- Test Jellyfin by opening the app and configuring a library. You should now see your mounted volume.
- Test Pihole with a DNS query to the new IP address:

```bash
nslookup google.com 10.20.0.53
```

```
Server:         10.20.0.53
Address:        10.20.0.53#53
