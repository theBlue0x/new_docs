# Running locally

In this guide we will show you how to run Tipi locally on your machine. This is useful if you want to contribute to the project or if you want to test new apps you added to the appstore.

## Prerequisites
- Docker desktop up to date and running. Instructions: [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Docker-compose
- Node version 16+

## Prepare
Once you have forked the repo and cloned it on your local machine you can start to prepare the environment.

## Install dependencies
Tipi uses `pnpm` as a package manager and monorepo orchestrator. Install it with
`npm i -g pnpm`

Install the project dependencies
`pnpm i`

## Run Tipi
1. Start the app with `npm run start:dev` from the root folder
2. Visit `localhost:3000` in your browser

## Stopping
When you have finished developing and stopped the server, the apps you've installed will still be running in their containers. To stop them and remove the images run:
`sudo ./scripts/stop.sh`

## Using your own appstore repo
You can change the repository Tipi is using to retrieve the appstore in order to test new apps you added.

Create a `settings.json` file in the `state` folder (`runtipi/state/settings.json`) containing the URL of your repo and restart Tipi.

```json
{
  "appsRepoUrl": "https://github.com/meienberger/runtipi-appstore.git"
}
```

If you need to be on a different branch than the main one in your repo, go in the repository directory `cd ./repos/<generated-id>` and checkout your branch.

```bash
git checkout mybranch
```
