# Installation

## Requirements

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or higher is recommended. However other major Linux distribution are supported but may lead to installation issues. Please file an issue if you encounter one.

If Docker is already installed on your machine, Tipi will use it to run the dashboard. Otherwise, it will install Docker for you.

<Callout type="warning">
If you already have docker installed make sure to have the docker compose plugin installed.<br/>
Run `docker compose version` to check if it is installed. Instructions to install it can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).

## Download and install Tipi

Download the latest version of Tipi:

```bash
curl -L https://setup.runtipi.io | bash
```

If you have some issue with the command above, you can also download the script directly from github:
  
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meienberger/runtipi/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The script will prompt you the ip address of the dashboard once configured.

## Commands

If you already installed Tipi, you can start it manually by running the `start.sh` script in the `runtipi` folder.

```bash
cd runtipi
sudo ./scripts/start.sh
```

Tipi will run by default on port 80. To select another port you can create a `settings.json` file in the `state` folder.
See the [Custom Settings](/docs/getting-started/custom-settings) section for more information.

To stop Tipi, run the stop script.

```bash
sudo ./scripts/stop.sh
```

## Update Tipi

To update Tipi to the latest version, run the update script.

```bash
sudo ./scripts/system.sh update
```
